These landing page designs are built to be used in HubSpot.

## Setup
You'll need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed. Then it's as simple as:
`npm install` or `sudo npm install`

## Build supporting files
One of the components packaged is [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). Therefore, simply run:
`grunt`
Files will be watched for changes and rebuilt as necessary.
