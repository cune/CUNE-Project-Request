# Concordia University, Nebraska Project Request
To support the Marketing office project request process by utilizing the project management system API.

## Configuration
Rename `config.sample.php` to `config.inc.php` and update variables.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcomed. Here's what you need to know to build locally.

### Setup
You'll need to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed. Then it's as simple as:
`npm install` or `sudo npm install`

### Build supporting files
One of the components packaged is [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). Therefore, simply run:
`grunt`
Files will be watched for changes and rebuilt as necessary.

### Styles are done in `LESS`
With the exception of the `build/css/semantic.min.css`, all CSS is built with the pre-processor.
